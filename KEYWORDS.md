## Adding new target keywords later

When you want to target a new phrase:

1. Use it in the **meta title** or **meta description** of the most relevant page (e.g. Properties, a service page, or a blog post).
2. Use it once or twice in **visible content** (headings or body) on that page.
3. Optionally add it to **index.html** `keywords` meta and/or **searchUtils** page keywords if it’s a main focus.

Avoid stuffing: keep sentences readable and user-focused. One clear use per page is usually enough.
